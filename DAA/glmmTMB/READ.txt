All data sets in this folder are generated by the original script. Steps conducted as follows:
- subset the original rarefied data set into smaller dataset by irrigation and fertilization
- filtering: subset data with more than 0.01% abundance and samples with >= 75 % of prevalence
- using glmmTMB package instead of glmer
- keep offset using the filterd data (no change)
